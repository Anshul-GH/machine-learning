    "1. SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "2. SVM is relatively memory efficient.\n",
    "3. SVMâ€™s are very good when we have no idea on the data.\n",
    "4. Works well with even unstructured and semi structured data like text, Images and trees.\n",
    "5. The kernel trick is real strength of SVM. With an appropriate kernel function, we can solve any complex problem.\n",
    "6. SVM models have generalization in practice, the risk of over-fitting is less in SVM."

    "Although SVMs are an attractive option when constructing a classifier, SVMs do not easily accommodate missing covariate information. Similar to other prediction and classification methods, in-attention to missing data when constructing an SVM can impact the accuracy and utility of the resulting classifier.\n",
