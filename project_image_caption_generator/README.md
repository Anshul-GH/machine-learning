What is Image Caption Generator?
Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural language like English.

Image Caption Generator with CNN â€“ About the Python based Project
The objective of our project is to learn the concepts of a CNN and LSTM model and build a working model of Image caption generator by implementing CNN with LSTM.

In this Python project, we will be implementing the caption generator using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long short term memory). The image features will be extracted from Xception which is a CNN model trained on the imagenet dataset and then we feed the features into the LSTM model which will be responsible for generating the image captions.
